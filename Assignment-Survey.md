## Assignment Summary

### During this project I felt like I showed my understanding of a lot of the concepts we've gone through in my time here. I was able to answer a lot of questions without going to outside sources (except Google of course). With things I didn't know, I was able to learn them and explain or show the resource I found. When something needed to be done I was able to step up and get it done. 

### Something I could have done better was helping with team member public speaking skills. I did a lot of speaking for the group when it came to explaining our plans and standups. 
 
### Side note:
### I felt like I was the middle man at times. What I mean by that is Fah and I were communicating directly and I would relay the message to our other two team members on what the game plan would be.
